# senzing-environment development

## Prerequisites for development

:thinking: The following tasks need to be complete before proceeding.
These are "one-time tasks" which may already have been completed.

1. The following software programs need to be installed:
    1. [git](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/git.md)

## Clone repository

For more information on environment variables,
see [Environment Variables](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/main/lists/environment-variables.md).

1. Set these environment variable values:

    ```console
    export GIT_ACCOUNT=senzing
    export GIT_REPOSITORY=senzing-environment
    export GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR=~/${GIT_ACCOUNT}.git
    export GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR="${GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR}/${GIT_REPOSITORY}"
    ```

1. Using the environment variables values just set, follow steps in [clone-repository](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/main/HOWTO/clone-repository.md) to install the Git repository.
